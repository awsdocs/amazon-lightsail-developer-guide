# Bucket naming rules in Amazon Lightsail<a name="bucket-naming-rules-in-amazon-lightsail"></a>

 *Last updated: July 14, 2021* 

When you create a bucket in the Amazon Lightsail object storage service, you must give it a name\. The name of the bucket is part of the URL that your customers will use when accessing objects that are stored in the bucket\. For example, if you name your bucket `DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET` in the `us-east-1` AWS Region, the URL for your bucket is `DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`\. You cannot change the name of your bucket after you create it\. Keep in mind that your customers are able to see the bucket name that you specify\. For more information about the Lightsail object storage service, see [Object storage in Amazon Lightsail](buckets-in-amazon-lightsail.md)\. For more information about creating buckets, see [Creating buckets in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-creating-buckets.md)\.

Bucket names must be DNS\-compliant\. Because of this, the following rules apply for naming buckets in Lightsail:
+ Bucket names must be between 3 and 56 characters long\.
+ Bucket names can consist only of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens \(\-\)\.
+ Bucket names must begin and end with a letter or number\.
+ Hyphens \(\-\) can separate words, but cannot be specified consecutively\. For example, `doc-example-bucket` is allowed but `doc--example--bucket` is not allowed\.
+ Bucket names must be unique within the `aws` \(Standard Regions\) partition, including buckets in Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\)\.

## Example bucket names<a name="example-bucket-names"></a>

The following example bucket names are valid and follow the recommended naming guidelines:
+ `docexamplebucket1`
+ `log-delivery-march-2020`
+ `my-hosted-content`

The following example bucket names are not allowed:
+ `doc.example.bucket`
+ `doc--example--bucket`
+ `doc-example-bucket-`

## Managing buckets and objects in Lightsail<a name="bucket-naming-rules-managing-buckets-and-objects"></a>

These are the general steps to manage your Lightsail object storage bucket:

1. Learn about objects and buckets in the Amazon Lightsail object storage service\. For more information, see [Object storage in Amazon Lightsail](buckets-in-amazon-lightsail.md)\.

1. Learn about the names that you can give your buckets in Amazon Lightsail\. For more information, see [Bucket naming rules in Amazon Lightsail](#bucket-naming-rules-in-amazon-lightsail)\.

1. Get started with the Lightsail object storage service by creating a bucket\. For more information, see [Creating buckets in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-creating-buckets.md)\.

1. Learn about the access permissions that you can configure for your bucket\. You can make all objects in your bucket public or private, or you can choose to make individual objects public\. You can also grant access to your bucket by creating access keys, attaching instances to your bucket, and granting access to other AWS accounts\. For more information, see [Understanding bucket permissions in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-understanding-bucket-permissions.md)\.

   After learning about bucket access permissions, see the following guides to grant access to your bucket:

1. Enable object versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your bucket\. For more information, see [Enabling and suspending object versioning in a bucket in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-managing-bucket-object-versioning.md)\.

1. After enabling object versioning, you can restore previous versions of objects in your bucket\. For more information, see [Restoring previous versions of objects in a bucket in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-restoring-bucket-object-versions.md)\.

1. Monitor the utilization of your bucket\. For more information, see [Viewing metrics for your bucket in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-viewing-bucket-metrics.md)\.

1. Configure an alarm for bucket metrics to be notified when the utilization of your bucket crosses a threshold\. For more information, see [Creating bucket metric alarms in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-adding-bucket-metric-alarms.md)\.

1. Change the storage plan of your bucket if it's running low on storage and network transfer\. For more information, see [Changing the plan of your bucket in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-changing-bucket-plans.md)\.

1. Learn how to connect your bucket to other resources\. For more information, see the following tutorials\.
