# Tutorial: Launch and configure a WordPress instance in Amazon Lightsail<a name="amazon-lightsail-tutorial-launching-and-configuring-wordpress"></a>

 *Last updated: November 1, 2018* 

Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) if you just need instances \(virtual private servers\)\. Lightsail includes everything you need to launch your project quickly—instances, managed databases, SSD\-based storage, backups \(snapshots\), data transfer, domain DNS management, static IPs, and load balancers—for a [low, predictable price](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/pricing/)\.

This tutorial shows you how to launch and configure a WordPress instance on Lightsail\. It includes steps to connect to your instance by using SSH, sign in to your WordPress website, create a static IP and attaching it to your instance, and create a DNS zone and mapping your domain\. When you’re done with this tutorial, you have the fundamentals to get your instance up and running on Lightsail\.

## Step 6: Create a Lightsail DNS zone and map a domain to your WordPress instance<a name="tutorial-launching-and-configuring-wordpress-creating-a-dns-zone"></a>

Transfer management of your domain's DNS records to Lightsail\. This allows you to more easily map a domain to your WordPress instance, and manage more of your website’s resources using the Lightsail console\.

Complete the following steps to create a Lightsail DNS zone and map a domain to your WordPress instance\.

**Note**  
For more information, see [Creating a DNS zone to manage your domain’s DNS records in Amazon Lightsail](lightsail-how-to-create-dns-entry.md)\.

1. On the **Networking** tab of the [Lightsail home page](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/), choose **Create DNS zone**\.  
![\[Launching and configuring WordPress in Lightsail.\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/cdafd3c2a6d9edfefee89eda217b0068/images/amazon-wordpress-tutorial-13.png)

1. Enter your domain, then choose **Create DNS zone**\.  
![\[Launching and configuring WordPress in Lightsail.\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/cdafd3c2a6d9edfefee89eda217b0068/images/amazon-wordpress-tutorial-14.png)

1. Make note of the name server addresses listed on the page\.

   You add these name server addresses to your domain name’s registrar to transfer management of your domain’s DNS records to Lightsail\.  
![\[Launching and configuring WordPress in Lightsail.\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/cdafd3c2a6d9edfefee89eda217b0068/images/amazon-wordpress-tutorial-15.png)

1. After management of your domain’s DNS records are transferred to Lightsail, add an A record to point the apex of your domain to your WordPress instance, as follows:

   1. In the DNS zone for your domain, choose **Add record**\.

   1. In the **Subdomain** box, enter an @ symbol to map the apex of your domain \(such as example\.com\) to your instance\. The @ symbol explicitly symbolizes that you’re adding an apex record\. It is not added as a subdomain\.

   1. In the **Maps to** box, choose the static IP that you attached to the WordPress instance in the previous step of this tutorial\.

   1. Choose the save icon\.  
![\[Launching and configuring WordPress in Lightsail.\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/cdafd3c2a6d9edfefee89eda217b0068/images/amazon-wordpress-tutorial-16.png)

   Allow time for the change to propagate through the internet's DNS before your domain begins routing traffic to your WordPress instance\.
