# Contributing to the Amazon Lightsail documentation on GitHub<a name="amazon-lightsail-making-contributions-to-documentation-on-github"></a>

 *Last updated: January 17, 2020* 

The Amazon Lightsail documentation is on GitHub in the [Lightsail developer guide repository](https://github.com/awsdocs/amazon-lightsail-developer-guide)\. In the repository, you can:
+ Fix typos and documentation bugs, add information, and rewrite sentences and paragraphs in the interest of accuracy or clarity\.
+ Write and submit new guides if there's something missing that you would like to see documented\.
+ Review the commit history to learn more about new feature and service launches and to track improvements to the documentation\.

In this guide, we show you how to [edit an existing guide](#editing-an-existing-guide) or how to [create a new guide](#creating-a-new-guide) by creating a pull request on GitHub\. After you submit a pull request, it will be reviewed by the Lightsail team and a decision will be made to accept it, reject it, or to engage in a conversation with you to learn more\. If your pull request is accepted, it will be published to the Lightsail documentation in the next round of updates \(typically within two weeks\)\.
