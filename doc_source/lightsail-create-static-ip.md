# Create a static IP and attach it to an instance in Amazon Lightsail<a name="lightsail-create-static-ip"></a>

 *Last updated: July 14, 2022* 

The default dynamic public IP address attached to your Amazon Lightsail instance changes every time you stop and restart the instance\. Create a static IP address and attach it to your instance to keep the public IP address from changing\. Later, when you point a registered domain name to your instance, you don’t have to update your domain’s DNS records every time you stop and restart your instance\. You can attach one static IP to an instance\. For more information, see [Static IP addresses in Amazon Lightsail](understanding-static-ip-addresses-in-amazon-lightsail.md)\.

## Prerequisites<a name="lightsail-create-static-ip-prerequisites"></a>

You need at least one instance running in Lightsail\. To create one, see [Create an instance in Lightsail](getting-started-with-amazon-lightsail.md)\.

1. Choose **Create static IP**\.

1. Select the AWS Region where you want to create your static IP\.
**Note**  
Static IP addresses can only be attached to instances in the same Region\.

1. Enter a name for your static IP\.

   Resource names:
   + Must be unique within each AWS Region in your Lightsail account\.

   + Must start and end with an alphanumeric character or number\.
