# Configuring resource access for a bucket in Amazon Lightsail<a name="amazon-lightsail-configuring-bucket-resource-access"></a>

 *Last updated: July 14, 2021* 

Attach an Amazon Lightsail instance to a Lightsail bucket to give it full programmatic access to the bucket and its objects\. When you attach instances to buckets, you don't have to manage credentials like access keys\. The instances and buckets that you attach must be in the same AWS Region\. You cannot attach instances to buckets that are in a different Region\.

Resource access is ideal if you're configuring software or a plugin on your instance to upload files directly to your bucket\. For example, if you want to configure a WordPress instance to store media files on a bucket\. For more information, see [Tutorial: Connecting a WordPress instance to an Amazon Lightsail bucket](amazon-lightsail-connecting-buckets-to-wordpress.md#amazon-lightsail-connecting-buckets-to-wordpress.title)\.

## Configure resource access for a bucket<a name="configure-bucket-resource-access"></a>

Complete the following procedure to configure resource access for a bucket\.

1. Sign in to the [Lightsail console](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/)\.

1. On the Lightsail home page, choose the **Storage** tab\.

1. Choose the name of the bucket for which you want to configure resource access\.

1. Choose the **Permissions** tab\.

   The **Resource access** section of the page displays the instances currently attached to the bucket, if any\.

1. Choose **Attach instance** to attach an instance to the bucket\.

1. In the **Select an instance** dropdown menu, select the instance that you want to attach to the bucket\.
**Note**  
You can attach instances that are in a running or stopped state only\. Additionally, you can attach only instances that are in the same AWS Region as the bucket\.

1. Choose **Attach** to attach the instance\. Otherwise, choose **Cancel**\.

   The instance has full access to the bucket and its objects after it's attached\. You can configure software or a plugin on your instance to programmatically upload and access files on your bucket\. For example, if you want to configure a WordPress instance to store media files on a bucket\. For more information, see [Tutorial: Connecting a WordPress instance to an Amazon Lightsail bucket](amazon-lightsail-connecting-buckets-to-wordpress.md)\.

## Managing buckets and objects in Lightsail<a name="resource-access-managing-buckets-and-objects"></a>

These are the general steps to manage your Lightsail object storage bucket:

1. Learn about objects and buckets in the Amazon Lightsail object storage service\. For more information, see [Object storage in Amazon Lightsail](buckets-in-amazon-lightsail.md)\.

1. Learn about the names that you can give your buckets in Amazon Lightsail\. For more information, see [Bucket naming rules in Amazon Lightsail](bucket-naming-rules-in-amazon-lightsail.md)\.

1. Get started with the Lightsail object storage service by creating a bucket\. For more information, see [Creating buckets in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-creating-buckets.md)\.

1. Learn about security best practices for buckets and the access permissions that you can configure for your bucket\. You can make all objects in your bucket public or private, or you can choose to make individual objects public\. You can also grant access to your bucket by creating access keys, attaching instances to your bucket, and granting access to other AWS accounts\. For more information, see [Security Best Practices for Amazon Lightsail object storage](amazon-lightsail-bucket-security-best-practices.md) and [Understanding bucket permissions in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-understanding-bucket-permissions.md)\.

   After learning about bucket access permissions, see the following guides to grant access to your bucket:

1. Learn how to enable access logging for your bucket, and how to use access logs to audit the security of your bucket\. For more information, see the following guides\.
   + [Access logging for buckets in the Amazon Lightsail object storage service](amazon-lightsail-bucket-access-logs.md)
   + [Access log format for a bucket in the Amazon Lightsail object storage service](amazon-lightsail-bucket-access-log-format.md)

   + [Using access logs for a bucket in Amazon Lightsail to identify requests](amazon-lightsail-using-bucket-access-logs.md)

1. Create an IAM policy that grants a user the ability to manage a bucket in Lightsail\. For more information, see [IAM policy to manage buckets in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-bucket-management-policies.md)\.

1. Learn about the way that objects in your bucket are labeled and identified\. For more information, see [Understanding object key names in Amazon Lightsail](understanding-bucket-object-key-names-in-amazon-lightsail.md)\.

1. Learn how to upload files and manage objects in your buckets\. For more information, see the following guides\.
   + [Uploading files to a bucket in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-uploading-files-to-a-bucket.md)
   + [Uploading files to a bucket in Amazon Lightsail using multipart upload](amazon-lightsail-uploading-files-to-a-bucket-using-multipart-upload.md)

1. Enable object versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your bucket\. For more information, see [Enabling and suspending object versioning in a bucket in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-managing-bucket-object-versioning.md)\.

1. After enabling object versioning, you can restore previous versions of objects in your bucket\. For more information, see [Restoring previous versions of objects in a bucket in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-restoring-bucket-object-versions.md)\.

1. Monitor the utilization of your bucket\. For more information, see [Viewing metrics for your bucket in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-viewing-bucket-metrics.md)\.

1. Configure an alarm for bucket metrics to be notified when the utilization of your bucket crosses a threshold\. For more information, see [Creating bucket metric alarms in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-adding-bucket-metric-alarms.md)\.

1. Change the storage plan of your bucket if it's running low on storage and network transfer\. For more information, see [Changing the plan of your bucket in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-changing-bucket-plans.md)\.

1. Learn how to connect your bucket to other resources\. For more information, see the following tutorials\.
