# Access log format for a bucket in the Amazon Lightsail object storage service<a name="amazon-lightsail-bucket-access-log-format"></a>

 *Last updated: November 1, 2021* 

Access logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket in the Amazon Lightsail object storage service\. You can use access logs for security and access audits, or learn about your customer base\. This section describes the format and other details about access log files\. For more information about logging basics, see [Access logging for buckets in the Amazon Lightsail object storage service](amazon-lightsail-bucket-access-logs.md)\.

Access log files consist of a sequence of newline\-delimited log records\. Each log record represents one request and consists of space\-delimited fields\.

The following is an example log consisting of five log records\.

## Log record fields<a name="log-record-fields"></a>

The following list describes the log record fields\.

**Access Point ARN \(Amazon Resource Name\)**

The Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the access point of the request\. If access point ARN is malformed or not used, the field will contain a '\-'\. For more information on access points, see [Using access points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html)\. For more information on ARNs, see the topic on [Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.

```

**Bucket Owner**

The canonical user ID of the owner of the source bucket\. The canonical user ID is another form of the AWS account ID\. For more information about the canonical user ID, see [AWS account identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/acct-identifiers.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\. For information about how to find the canonical user ID for your account, see [Finding the canonical user ID for your AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/acct-identifiers.html#FindingCanonicalId)\.

**Bucket**

The name of the bucket that the request was processed against\. If the system receives a malformed request and cannot determine the bucket, the request will not appear in any access log\.

Example entry

```

```

**Time**

The time at which the request was received; these dates and times are in Coordinated Universal Time \(UTC\)\. The format, using *strftime\(\)* terminology, is as follows: *\[%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z\]*

Example entry

```

**Requester**

The canonical user ID of the requester, or a `-` for unauthenticated requests\. If the requester was an IAM user, this field returns the requester's IAM user name along with the AWS root account that the IAM user belongs to\. This identifier is the same one used for access control purposes\.

## Custom access log information<a name="custom-access-log-information"></a>

You can include custom information to be stored in the access log record for a request\. To do this, add a custom query\-string parameter to the URL for the request\. Lightsail ignores query\-string parameters that begin with "x\-", but includes those parameters in the access log record for the request, as part of the `Request-URI` field of the log record\.

For example, a `GET` request for `"s3.amazonaws.com/awsexamplebucket1/photos/2019/08/puppy.jpg?x-user=johndoe"` works the same as the request for `"s3.amazonaws.com/awsexamplebucket1/photos/2019/08/puppy.jpg"`, except that the `"x-user=johndoe"` string is included in the `Request-URI` field for the associated log record\. This functionality is available in the REST interface only\.

## Programming considerations for extensible access log format<a name="programing-considerations"></a>

Occasionally we might extend the access log record format by adding new fields to the end of each line\. Therefore, you should write any code that parses access logs to handle trailing fields that it might not understand\.

## Managing buckets and objects in Lightsail<a name="bucket-access-log-format-managing-buckets-and-objects"></a>

These are the general steps to manage your Lightsail object storage bucket:

1. Learn about objects and buckets in the Amazon Lightsail object storage service\. For more information, see [Object storage in Amazon Lightsail](buckets-in-amazon-lightsail.md)\.

1. Learn about the names that you can give your buckets in Amazon Lightsail\. For more information, see [Bucket naming rules in Amazon Lightsail](bucket-naming-rules-in-amazon-lightsail.md)\.

1. Get started with the Lightsail object storage service by creating a bucket\. For more information, see [Creating buckets in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-creating-buckets.md)\.

1. Learn about security best practices for buckets and the access permissions that you can configure for your bucket\. You can make all objects in your bucket public or private, or you can choose to make individual objects public\. You can also grant access to your bucket by creating access keys, attaching instances to your bucket, and granting access to other AWS accounts\. For more information, see [Security Best Practices for Amazon Lightsail object storage](amazon-lightsail-bucket-security-best-practices.md) and [Understanding bucket permissions in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-understanding-bucket-permissions.md)\.

   After learning about bucket access permissions, see the following guides to grant access to your bucket:

1. Create an IAM policy that grants a user the ability to manage a bucket in Lightsail\. For more information, see [IAM policy to manage buckets in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-bucket-management-policies.md)\.

1. Learn about the way that objects in your bucket are labeled and identified\. For more information, see [Understanding object key names in Amazon Lightsail](understanding-bucket-object-key-names-in-amazon-lightsail.md)\.

   + [Tagging objects in a bucket in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-tagging-bucket-objects.md)
   + [Deleting objects in a bucket in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-deleting-bucket-objects.md)

1. Enable object versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your bucket\. For more information, see [Enabling and suspending object versioning in a bucket in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-managing-bucket-object-versioning.md)\.

1. After enabling object versioning, you can restore previous versions of objects in your bucket\. For more information, see [Restoring previous versions of objects in a bucket in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-restoring-bucket-object-versions.md)\.

1. Monitor the utilization of your bucket\. For more information, see [Viewing metrics for your bucket in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-viewing-bucket-metrics.md)\.

1. Configure an alarm for bucket metrics to be notified when the utilization of your bucket crosses a threshold\. For more information, see [Creating bucket metric alarms in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-adding-bucket-metric-alarms.md)\.

1. Change the storage plan of your bucket if it's running low on storage and network transfer\. For more information, see [Changing the plan of your bucket in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-changing-bucket-plans.md)\.

1. Learn how to connect your bucket to other resources\. For more information, see the following tutorials\.
   + [Tutorial: Connecting a WordPress instance to an Amazon Lightsail bucket](amazon-lightsail-connecting-buckets-to-wordpress.md)
   + [Tutorial: Using an Amazon Lightsail bucket with a Lightsail content delivery network distribution](amazon-lightsail-using-distributions-with-buckets.md)
