# Changing custom domains for your Amazon Lightsail distribution<a name="amazon-lightsail-changing-distribution-custom-domains"></a>

 *Last updated: July 23, 2020* 

You can change the custom domains used by your Amazon Lightsail distribution to another domain or set of domains\. To do so, you must first create a new SSL/TLS certificate for the domains that you want to use with your distribution\. For more information, see [Creating SSL/TLS certificates for your Amazon Lightsail distribution](amazon-lightsail-create-a-distribution-certificate.md)\. After the new certificate is validated, you swap the old certificate for the new one, thereby changing the custom domains for your distribution\.

For more information about distributions, see [Creating Amazon Lightsail distributions](amazon-lightsail-creating-content-delivery-network-distribution.md)\.

## Changing custom domains for your distribution<a name="changing-distribution-custom-domains"></a>

Complete the following procedure to change the custom domains for your distribution\.

1. Sign in to the [Lightsail console](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/)\.

1. On the Lightsail home page, choose the **Networking** tab\.

1. Choose the name of the distribution for which you want to change the custom domains\.

1. Choose the **Custom domains** tab on your distribution's management page\.

1. Choose **Change custom domains and certificate**\.

1. Choose the name of the certificate for the new domains, then choose **Save**\.

1. At the prompt, choose **Yes, save** to confirm the change\.

   Your distribution's status changes to **In progress**, and it takes a few moments for the changes to take effect\.

After you change the custom domain of your distribution, you must still edit the DNS records of your new domains to direct traffic to your distribution\. For more information, see [Pointing your domains to your Amazon Lightsail distributions](amazon-lightsail-point-domain-to-distribution.md)\. You might also want to edit the DNS records of your old domains, because continuing to direct traffic for those domains to your distribution will display an error\.
