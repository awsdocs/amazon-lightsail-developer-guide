# Download an SSL certificate for your managed database in Amazon Lightsail<a name="amazon-lightsail-download-ssl-certificate-for-managed-database"></a>

 *Last updated: May 20, 2021* 

**Important**  
The certificates labeled as `rds-ca-2015` expire on March 5, 2020\. We strongly recommend that you start using the certificates labeled as `rds-ca-2019` as soon as possible\. For more information, see [Modifying your managed database in Amazon Lightsail to use a specific certificate](amazon-lightsail-modifying-database-to-use-a-specific-certificate.md)\.

You can use Secure Socket Layer \(SSL\) or Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) from your application to encrypt a connection to a managed database in Amazon Lightsail running MySQL, or PostgreSQL\. Each DB engine has its own process for implementing SSL/TLS\. For more information, see [Using SSL to connect to your MySQL database in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-connecting-to-mysql-database-using-ssl.md) or [Using SSL to connect to your PostgreSQL database in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-connecting-to-postgres-database-using-ssl.md)\.

**Note**  
The certificates available for download are labeled for Amazon Relational Database Service \(Amazon RDS\), but also work for managed databases in Lightsail\.

To get a certificate bundle that contains both the intermediate and root certificates, download from [https://s3\.amazonaws\.com/rds\-downloads/rds\-combined\-ca\-bundle\.pem](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem)\.

To get a root certificate that works for all AWS Regions, download from one of these locations:
+ [https://s3\.amazonaws\.com/rds\-downloads/rds\-ca\-2019\-root\.pem](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-ca-2019-root.pem)
+ [https://s3\.amazonaws\.com/rds\-downloads/rds\-ca\-2015\-root\.pem](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-ca-2015-root.pem)

This root certificate is a trusted root entity and should work in most cases but might fail if your application doesn't accept certificate chains\. If your application doesn't accept certificate chains, download the AWS Regionâ€“specific certificate from the list of intermediate certificates found later in this section\.

If your application is on Microsoft Windows and requires a PKCS7 file, you can download the PKCS7 certificate bundle\. This bundle contains both the intermediate and root certificates at [https://s3\.amazonaws\.com/rds\-downloads/rds\-combined\-ca\-bundle\.p7b](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.p7b)\.

## Intermediate certificates<a name="intermediate-certificates"></a>

You might need to use an intermediate certificate to connect to your AWS Region\. If you need an intermediate certificate for a particular AWS Region, download the certificate from the following list\.
