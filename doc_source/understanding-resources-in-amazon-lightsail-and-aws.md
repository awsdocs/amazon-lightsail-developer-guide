# Resources in Amazon Lightsail and AWS<a name="understanding-resources-in-amazon-lightsail-and-aws"></a>

**Note**  
In AWS, everything you create and work with is called a resource\. A virtual private server \(or *instance*\) is a resource, a database is a resource, and so on\. In Lightsail, resources include Lightsail instances, static IP addresses, DNS zones, and instance snapshots\.
