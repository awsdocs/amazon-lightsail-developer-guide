# Connecting to your Windows instance in Amazon Lightsail<a name="connect-to-your-windows-based-instance-using-amazon-lightsail"></a>

 *Last updated: March 30, 2020* 

You can connect to your Windows Server instance in Amazon Lightsail using the browser\-based RDP client that is available in the Lightsail console\. The browser\-based RDP client does not require software installation, and you can connect to your Windows Server instance immediately after you create it, and it becomes available\. Connect to your instance to perform administrative tasks on the server, such as installing software, or configuring web applications\.

You can also use your own RDP client to connect to your instance, such as the Remote Desktop Connection that is bundled with Windows\. For more information about configuring your own RDP client, see [Connecting to your Windows instance in Amazon Lightsail using the Remote Desktop Connection client](amazon-lightsail-connecting-to-windows-instance-using-rdc.md)\. To connect to a Linux or Unix instance in Lightsail, see [Connecting to your Linux or Unix instance in Amazon Lightsail](lightsail-how-to-connect-to-your-instance-virtual-private-server.md)\.

## Default administrator password for Windows Server instances<a name="windows-admin-password"></a>

A randomly generated default administrator password is assigned to Windows Server instances when they are created\. The browser\-based RDP client in the Lightsail console uses the default administrator password to sign in to your instance\. If you change the administrator password on your instance, you will be prompted to manually enter your new password each time you try to connect to your instance using the browser\-based RDP client\. Lightsail does not store your new administrator password, and it cannot be retrieved from your instance\.

**Important**  
If you lose your administrator password, you will not be able to sign in to your instance, and there is no way to reset the password\. Store your new administrator password in a secure location where you can retrieve it later if you lose it, such as AWS Secrets Manager\. For more information, see the [AWS Secrets Manager User guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html)\.

You can change the administrator password back to the original default administrator password to avoid being prompted for it each time you access your instance using the browser\-based RDP client\. You can find the original default administrator password by choosing the **Instances** tab in the [Lightsail home page](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/)\. Choose the name of your Windows Server instance, choose the **Connect** tab, and choose **Show default password** to view the original default administrator password as shown in the following example\.
