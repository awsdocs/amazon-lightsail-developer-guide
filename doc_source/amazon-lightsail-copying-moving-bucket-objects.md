# Copying or moving objects in a bucket in Amazon Lightsail<a name="amazon-lightsail-copying-moving-bucket-objects"></a>

 *Last updated: January 10, 2022* 

You can copy objects that are already stored in your bucket in the Amazon Lightsail object storage service\. In this guide, we show you how to copy objects using the Lightsail console and using the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)\. Copy objects in your bucket to create duplicate copies of objects, rename objects, or move objects across Lightsail locations \(for example, moving objects from one AWS Region to another one, in which Lightsail is available\)\. You can copy objects across locations only using the AWS APIs, AWS SDKs, and AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)\.

For more information about buckets, see [Object storage in Amazon Lightsail](buckets-in-amazon-lightsail.md)\.

## Restrictions for copying objects<a name="copying-moving-bucket-objects-restrictions"></a>

You can create a copy of an object that is up to 2 GB in size by using the Lightsail console\. You can create a copy of an object that is up to 5 GB in size with a single copy object action by using the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\), AWS APIs, and AWS SDKs\. To copy an object that is greater than 5 GB in size, you must use the multipart upload action of the AWS CLI, AWS APIs, and AWS SDKs\. For more information, see [Uploading files to a bucket in Amazon Lightsail using multipart upload](amazon-lightsail-uploading-files-to-a-bucket-using-multipart-upload.md)\.

## Copy objects using the Lightsail console<a name="copying-moving-bucket-objects-lightsail-console"></a>

Complete the following procedure to copy an object stored in a bucket using the Lightsail console\. To move an object in a bucket, you should copy it to the new location, and delete the original object\.

1. Sign in to the [Lightsail console](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/)\.

1. On the Lightsail home page, choose the **Storage** tab\.

1. Choose the name of the bucket for which you want to copy an object\.

1. In the **Objects** tab, use the **Objects browser pane** to browse to the location of the object that you want to copy\.

1. Add a checkmark next to the object that you want to copy\.

1. In the **Object information** pane, choose the actions \(â‹®\) menu, and then choose **Copy to**\.

1. In the **Select destination** pane that appears, browse to the location in the bucket where you want to copy the selected object\. You can also create a new path by entering folder names into the **Destination path** text box\.

1. Choose **Copy** to copy the object to the selected or specified destination\. Otherwise, choose **No, cancel**\.

   A **Copy complete** message is displayed when the object is successfully copied\. You should delete the original object if your intent was to move the object\. For more information, see [Deleting objects in a bucket in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-deleting-bucket-objects.md)\.

## Copy objects using the AWS CLI<a name="copying-moving-bucket-objects-aws-cli"></a>

Complete the following procedure to copy objects in a bucket using the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)\. You do this by using the `copy-object` command\. For more information, see [copy\-object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/copy-object.html) in the *AWS CLI Command Reference*\.

**Note**  
You must install the AWS CLI and configure it for Lightsail and Amazon S3 before continuing with this procedure\. For more information, see [Configuring the AWS Command Line Interface to work with Amazon Lightsail](lightsail-how-to-set-up-and-configure-aws-cli.md)\.

1. Open a Command Prompt or Terminal window\.

1. Enter the following command to copy an object in your bucket\.

   ```
   aws s3api copy-object --copy-source SourceBucketNameAndObjectKey --key DestinationObjectKey --bucket DestinationBucketName --acl bucket-owner-full-control
   ```

   In the command, replace the following example text with your own:
   + *SourceBucketNameAndObjectKey* \- The name of the bucket in which the source object currently exists, and the full object key of the object to be copied\. For example, to copy the object `images/sailbot.jpg` from the bucket `DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET`, specify `DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/images/sailbot.jpg`\.
   + *DestinationObjectKey* \- The full object key of the new object copy\.
   + *DestinationBucket* \- The name of the destination bucket\.

   Examples:
   + Copying an object in a bucket to the same bucket:

     ```
     aws s3api copy-object --copy-source DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/images/sailbot.jpg --key media/sailbot.jpg --bucket DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET --acl bucket-owner-full-control
     ```
   + Copying an object from one bucket to another bucket:

     ```
     aws s3api copy-object --copy-source DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-1/images/sailbot.jpg --key images/sailbot.jpg --bucket DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-2 --acl bucket-owner-full-control
     ```

   You should see a result similar to the following example:

## Managing buckets and objects in Lightsail<a name="moving-objects-managing-buckets-and-objects"></a>

These are the general steps to manage your Lightsail object storage bucket:

1. Learn about objects and buckets in the Amazon Lightsail object storage service\. For more information, see [Object storage in Amazon Lightsail](buckets-in-amazon-lightsail.md)\.

1. Learn about the names that you can give your buckets in Amazon Lightsail\. For more information, see [Bucket naming rules in Amazon Lightsail](bucket-naming-rules-in-amazon-lightsail.md)\.

1. Get started with the Lightsail object storage service by creating a bucket\. For more information, see [Creating buckets in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-creating-buckets.md)\.

1. Learn about security best practices for buckets and the access permissions that you can configure for your bucket\. You can make all objects in your bucket public or private, or you can choose to make individual objects public\. You can also grant access to your bucket by creating access keys, attaching instances to your bucket, and granting access to other AWS accounts\. For more information, see [Security Best Practices for Amazon Lightsail object storage](amazon-lightsail-bucket-security-best-practices.md) and [Understanding bucket permissions in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-understanding-bucket-permissions.md)\.

   After learning about bucket access permissions, see the following guides to grant access to your bucket:
