 *Last updated: July 30, 2019* 

You can use the Remote Desktop Connection \(RDC\) client included with the Windows operating system to connect to your Windows instance in Amazon Lightsail\. RDC requires that you use the administrator user name and password for the Windows instance, which could be the default password assigned to the instance when it’s created or your own password if you changed the default password\.

This topic walks you through the steps to obtain your default administrator password from the Lightsail console, and configure RDC to connect to your Windows instance\. You can also connect to your instance from within the Lightsail console using your browser\. For more information, see [Connecting to your Windows instance in Amazon Lightsail using the web\-based RDP client](connect-to-your-windows-based-instance-using-amazon-lightsail.md)\.

   Continue to the next section of this guide to configure RDC, and paste the password into the client\.
