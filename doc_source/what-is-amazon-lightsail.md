# What is Amazon Lightsail?<a name="what-is-amazon-lightsail"></a>

 *Last updated: April 1, 2021* 

Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with Amazon Web Services \(AWS\) for developers who need to build websites or web applications\. It includes everything you need to launch your project quickly \- instances \(virtual private servers\), container services, managed databases, content delivery network \(CDN\) distributions, load balancers, SSD\-based block storage, static IP addresses, DNS management of registered domains, and resource snapshots \(backups\) \- for a low, predictable monthly price\.

## Who is Lightsail for?<a name="who-is-lightsail-for"></a>

Lightsail is for developers\. You can choose an image for your Lightsail instance that jumpstarts your dev project so you don't have to spend as much time installing software or frameworks\.

If you're an individual developer or hobbyist working on a personal project, Lightsail can help you deploy and manage basic cloud resources\. You might also be interested in learning or experimenting with cloud services, such as virtual machines or networking\. Lightsail provides a quick way to get started\.

Lightsail has images with base operating systems, development stacks like LAMP, LEMP \(Nginx\), and SQL Server Express, and applications like WordPress, Drupal, and Magento\. For more detailed information about the software installed on each image, see [Choose a Lightsail instance image](compare-options-choose-lightsail-instance-image.md)\.

As your project grows, you can add block storage disks and attach them to your Lightsail instance\. You can take snapshots of these instances and disks and easily create new instances from those snapshots\. You can also peer your VPC so that your Lightsail instances can use other AWS resources outside of Lightsail\.

You can also create a Lightsail load balancer and attach target instances to create a highly available application\. You can also configure your load balancer to handle encrypted \(HTTPS\) traffic, session persistence, health checking, and more\.
