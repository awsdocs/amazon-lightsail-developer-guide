![\[Launching and configuring a Windows Server 2016 instance in Lightsail.\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/f1c62fa5316bf1df017e7afb5a0e0a21/images/amazon-ws-tutorial-06.png)

## Step 4: Create a Lightsail static IP address and attach it to your Windows Server 2016 instance<a name="tutorial-launching-and-configuring-windows-server-2016-creating-a-lightsail-static-ip"></a>

The default public IP for your Windows Server 2016 instance changes if you stop and start the instance\. A static IP address, attached to an instance, stays the same even if you stop and start your instance\.

Create a static IP address and attach it to your Windows Server 2016 instance\. For more information, see [Create a static IP and attach it to an instance in Amazon Lightsail](lightsail-create-static-ip.md) in the Lightsail documentation\.

1. On the **Instances** tab of the Lightsail home page, choose your running Windows Server 2016 instance\.  
![\[Launching and configuring a Windows Server 2016 instance in Lightsail.\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/f1c62fa5316bf1df017e7afb5a0e0a21/images/amazon-ws-tutorial-09.png)

1. Choose the **Networking** tab, then choose **Create static IP**\.  
![\[Launching and configuring a Windows Server 2016 instance in Lightsail.\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/f1c62fa5316bf1df017e7afb5a0e0a21/images/amazon-wordpress-tutorial-10.png)

1. The static IP location, and attached instance are pre\-selected based on the instance that you chose earlier in this tutorial\.  
![\[Launching and configuring a Windows Server 2016 instance in Lightsail.\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/f1c62fa5316bf1df017e7afb5a0e0a21/images/amazon-ws-tutorial-11.png)

1. Enter a name for your static IP\.

   Resource names:
   + Must be unique within each AWS Region in your Lightsail account\.
   + Must contain 2 to 255 characters\.
   + Must start and end with an alphanumeric character or number\.
   + Can include alphanumeric characters, numbers, periods, dashes, and underscores\.

1. Choose **Create**\.  
![\[Launching and configuring a Windows Server 2016 instance in Lightsail.\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/f1c62fa5316bf1df017e7afb5a0e0a21/images/amazon-wordpress-tutorial-12.png)

## Step 5: Create a Lightsail DNS zone and map a domain to your Windows Server 2016 instance<a name="tutorial-launching-and-configuring-windows-server-2016-creating-a-dns-zone"></a>

Transfer management of your domain's DNS records to Lightsail\. This allows you to more easily map a domain to your Windows Server 2016 instance, and manage all of your website’s resources using the Lightsail console\. For more information, see [Creating a DNS zone to manage your domain’s DNS records in Amazon Lightsail](lightsail-how-to-create-dns-entry.md) in the Lightsail documentation\.

1. On the **Domains & DNS** tab of the Lightsail home page, choose **Create DNS zone**\.

1. Enter your domain, then choose **Create DNS zone**\.

1. Make note of the name server addresses listed on the page\.

   You add these name server addresses to your domain name’s registrar to transfer management of your domain’s DNS records to Lightsail\.  
![\[Launching and configuring a LAMP instance in Lightsail.\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/f1c62fa5316bf1df017e7afb5a0e0a21/images/amazon-wordpress-tutorial-15.png)

1. After management of your domain’s DNS records are transferred to Lightsail, add an A record to point the apex of your domain to your LAMP instance, as follows:

   1. In the **Assignments** tab of the DNS zone, choose **Add assignment**\.

   1. In the **Select a domain** field, choose the domain or subdomain\.

   1. In the **Select a resource** drop down, select the LAMP instance you created earlier in this tutorial\.

   1. Choose the **Assign**\.

   Allow time for the change to propagate through the internet's DNS before your domain begins routing traffic to your LAMP instance\.
