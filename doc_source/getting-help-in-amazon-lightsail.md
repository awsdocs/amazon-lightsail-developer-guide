# Getting help in Amazon Lightsail<a name="getting-help-in-amazon-lightsail"></a>

 *Last updated: May 17, 2017* 

In Amazon Lightsail, you can get help in several ways\.

## Context\-sensitive help panel in Lightsail<a name="getting-help-in-lightsail-context-sensitive-help-panel"></a>

Lightsail has a context\-sensitive **Help** panel on each page of the console with additional tips and information that are specific to the page you're on\. Open the help panel any time you have a question about something on the page, and close it when you're good to go\. You can open the help panel by choosing **Help** on any page, or by choosing any of the small question marks throughout the user interface\.

## Using the Lightsail CLI and API<a name="using-the-cli-and-lightsail-api"></a>

You can use the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) or the Lightsail REST API to create, read, update, and delete Lightsail resources\. In addition to the REST API, we also have an SDK in multiple languages, including Java, Ruby, JavaScript \(Node\.js\), Go, PHP, Python, \.NET \(C\#\), and C\+\+\. For more information about the Lightsail API, see the [Lightsail API reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/2016-11-28/api-reference/Welcome.html)\.

**Note**  
You need to generate access keys to use the Lightsail API\. [Learn more about setting up access keys to use the Lightsail API](lightsail-how-to-set-up-access-keys-to-use-sdk-api-cli.md)\.

The AWS CLI is helpful when you work with your Lightsail resources\. In the AWS CLI, just type `aws lightsail help` to learn about the available commands\. For help on a specific CLI command, type the command name followed by `help` to learn more about its parameters and exceptions\. For more information, see the [Lightsail CLI reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lightsail/index.html)\.
