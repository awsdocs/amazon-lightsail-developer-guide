# Set up SSH for your Linux/Unix\-based Lightsail instances<a name="lightsail-how-to-set-up-ssh"></a>

*Last updated: October 16, 2017*

Secure SHell \(SSH\) is a protocol for securely connecting to a virtual private server \(or Lightsail *instance*\)\. SSH works by creating a public key and a private key that match the remote server to an authorized user\. Using that key pair, you can connect to your Lightsail instance using a browser\-based SSH terminal\.

For more information about SSH, see [Understanding SSH in Amazon Lightsail](understanding-ssh-in-amazon-lightsail.md)\.

When you create your Lightsail instance, the default option is to let Lightsail manage your SSH keys for you\. Lightsail provides a browser\-based SSH client for securely connecting to your Linux\-based instance\. It's a fully functional terminal, where you can enter commands and make changes to your instance\.

Windows\-based instances use remote desktop \(RDP\) protocol instead of SSH\. For more information about Windows\-based instances in Lightsail, see [Get started with Windows\-based instances in Lightsail](get-started-with-windows-based-instances-in-lightsail.md)\.

**Important**  
SSH key management is regional\. When you create an instance in a new AWS Region, you will be given the option to use the default key pair for that region\. You can also use a custom key in that region\. Keep in mind that if you upload your own key, you'll have to do that for each region where you have a Lightsail instance\.

If you use the default key, you can still download the private key for safekeeping\. This can be done either at the time you create your instance or later\. If you choose to download the key after you created your instance, you can do so under **SSH keys** on the **Account** page\.

## Create a new key<a name="lightsail-set-up-ssh-create-new-key"></a>

If you don't choose to use the default key, you can create a new key pair at the time you create your Lightsail instance\.

1. If you haven't done it yet, choose **Create instance**\.

1. On the **Create an instance** page, choose **change SSH key pair**\.

1. Choose **Create new**\.

1. Lightsail displays the region where we're creating the new key\.  
![\[Here's the region where your key pair is being created\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/2c7274df55d082980824e6f5d4268a07/images/amazon-lightsail-create-new-key-pair-in-region.png)

   Choose **Create**\.

1. Enter a name for your key pair\.

   Resource names:
   + Must be unique within each AWS Region in your Lightsail account\.
   + Must contain 2 to 255 characters\.
   + Must start and end with an alphanumeric character or number\.
   + Can include alphanumeric characters, numbers, periods, dashes, and underscores\.

1. Choose **Generate key pair**\.
**Important**  
Save your key somewhere you can easily find it\. Also, it's a good idea to make sure permissions are set so that no one else can read it\.

1. Continue creating your instance\.

## Upload an existing key<a name="lightsail-set-up-ssh-upload-existing-key"></a>

You can also choose to upload an existing key at the time you create your Lightsail instance\.

1. If you haven't done it yet, choose **Create instance**\.

1. On the **Create an instance** page, choose **change SSH key pair**\.

1. Choose **Upload new**\.

1. Lightsail displays the region where you're uploading the new key\.

   Choose **Upload**\.

1. Choose **Browse** to find the key on your local machine\.

   Be sure to upload a public key \(not a private key\)\. For example, `github_rsa.pub`\.

1. Choose **Upload key**\.

1. Continue creating your instance\.

## Managing your keys<a name="lightsail-set-up-ssh-key-management"></a>

You can manage your keys on the **SSH keys** tab of the **Account** page\. You will see each key pair in use in each region\.

On this page, you can change the key that should be used by default when you create new Lightsail instances\. You can also create a new key, upload an existing key, or download a private key\. You may want to use an SSH client like PuTTY to connect, which will require you to have the private half of the key\. You can download the key on the **Account** page\.
