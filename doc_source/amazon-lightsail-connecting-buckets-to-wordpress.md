# Tutorial: Connecting a WordPress instance to an Amazon Lightsail bucket<a name="amazon-lightsail-connecting-buckets-to-wordpress"></a>

 *Last updated: July 14, 2021* 

This tutorial describes the steps required to connect your WordPress website running on an Amazon Lightsail instance to a Lightsail bucket\. You can use the bucket to host static content such as images and attachments\. To do this, you must install the WP Offload Media Lite plugin on your WordPress website and configure it to connect to your Lightsail bucket\. After the plugin is configured, all media that you upload to your WordPress website is automatically added to your bucket instead of the instanceâ€™s disk\.

## Step 1: Complete the prerequisites<a name="connecting-buckets-to-wordpress-prerequisites"></a>

Complete the following prerequisites if you haven't already:
+ Create a WordPress instance in Lightsail\. For more information, see [Tutorial: Launch and configure a WordPress instance in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-tutorial-launching-and-configuring-wordpress.md)\.
+ Create a bucket in the Lightsail object storage service\. For more information, see [Creating buckets in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-creating-buckets.md)\.

## Step 2: Modify your bucket permissions<a name="connecting-buckets-to-wordpress-modify-bucket-permissions"></a>

Complete the following procedure to change the permissions of your bucket to give access to your WordPress instance and the Offload Media Lite plugin\. The access permissions of your bucket must be set to **Individual objects can be made public \(read\-only\)**\. You must also attach the WordPress instance to the access role of your bucket\. For more information about bucket permissions, see [Understanding bucket permissions in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-understanding-bucket-permissions.md)\.

1. Sign in to the [Lightsail console](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/)\.

1. On the Lightsail home page, choose the **Storage** tab\.

1. Choose the name of the bucket that you want to use with your WordPress website\.

1. Choose the **Permissions** tab on the **Bucket management** page\.

1. Choose **Change permissions** under the **Bucket access permissions** section of the page\.  
![\[\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/2c7274df55d082980824e6f5d4268a07/images/amazon-lightsail-bucket-access-permissions.png)

1. Choose **Individual objects can be made public and read only**\.  
![\[\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/2c7274df55d082980824e6f5d4268a07/images/amazon-lightsail-bucket-access-permissions-options.png)

1. Choose **Save**\.

1. Choose **Yes, save** in the confirmation prompt that appears\.  
![\[\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/2c7274df55d082980824e6f5d4268a07/images/amazon-lightsail-bucket-access-permissions-confirmation.png)

   After a few moments, your bucket is configured to allow for individual object access\. This ensures that objects uploaded to your bucket from your WordPress website using the Offload Media Lite plugin are readable to your customers\.

1. Scroll to the **Resource access** section of the page, and choose **Attach instance**\.  
![\[\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/2c7274df55d082980824e6f5d4268a07/images/amazon-lightsail-bucket-resource-access.png)

1. Choose the name of your WordPress instance in the drop\-down list that appears, and then choose **Attach**\.  
![\[\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/2c7274df55d082980824e6f5d4268a07/images/amazon-lightsail-bucket-attach-resource-access.png)

   After a few moments, your WordPress instance is attached to your bucket\. This gives your WordPress instance access to manage your bucket and its objects\.

## Step 3: Install the WP Offload Media Lite plugin on your WordPress website<a name="connecting-buckets-to-wordpress-install-wp-offload-media-lite"></a>

Complete the following procedure to install the WP Offload Media Lite plugin on your WordPress website\. This plugin automatically copies images, videos, documents, and any other media added through the WordPress media uploader to your Lightsail bucket\. For more information, see [WP Offload Media Lite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-s3-and-cloudfront/) in the *WordPress website*\.

1. Sign in to the dashboard of your WordPress website as an administrator\.

   For more information, see [Getting the application user name and password for your 'Certified by Bitnami' instance in Amazon Lightsail](log-in-to-your-bitnami-application-running-on-amazon-lightsail.md)\.

1. Pause on **Plugins** in the left navigation menu, and choose **Add New**\.  
![\[Add new plugin menu item in the WordPress dashboard.\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/2c7274df55d082980824e6f5d4268a07/images/amazon-lightsail-wordpress-add-new-plugin-menu.png)

1. Search for **WP Offload Media Lite**\.

1. In the search results, choose **Install Now** next to the **WP Offload Media** plugin\.  
![\[WP Offload Media Lite plugin for WordPress.\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/2c7274df55d082980824e6f5d4268a07/images/amazon-lightsail-wp-offload-media-plugin.png)

1. Choose **Activate** after the plugin is done installing\.

1. In the left navigation menu, choose **Settings**, and then choose **Offload Media**\.  
![\[Wordpress dashboard settings.\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/2c7274df55d082980824e6f5d4268a07/images/amazon-lightsail-offload-media-menu.png)

1. In the **Offload Media** page, choose **Amazon S3** as the storage provider\.  
![\[WP Offload Media page.\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/2c7274df55d082980824e6f5d4268a07/images/amazon-lightsail-offload-media-storage-provider.png)

1. Choose **Next**\.  
![\[WP Offload Media page.\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/2c7274df55d082980824e6f5d4268a07/images/amazon-lightsail-offload-media-next.png)

1. Choose **Browse existing buckets** in the **What bucket would you like to use?** page that appears\.  
![\[WP Offload Media page.\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/2c7274df55d082980824e6f5d4268a07/images/amazon-lightsail-offload-media-browse-existing-buckets.png)

![\[WP Offload Media page.\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/2c7274df55d082980824e6f5d4268a07/images/amazon-lightsail-offload-media-existing-buckets.png)

1. In the **Offload Media Lite Settings** page that appears, make sure to turn on **Force HTTPS** and **Remove Files From Server**\.
   + The **Force HTTPS** setting must be turned on because Lightsail buckets use HTTPS by default to serve media files\. If you don't turn this feature on, media files that are uploaded to your Lightsail bucket from your WordPress website won't be be served correctly to your website visitors\.
   + The **Remove Files From Server** setting ensures that media that is uploaded to your Lightsail bucket isn't also stored on your instance's disk\. If you don't turn this feature on, media files that are uploaded to your Lightsail bucket are also stored on the local storage of your WordPress instance\.  
![\[WP Offload Media page.\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/2c7274df55d082980824e6f5d4268a07/images/amazon-lightsail-offload-media-settings.png)

1. Choose **Save Changes**\.
**Note**  
To return to the **Offload Media Lite Settings** page later, pause on **Settings** in the left navigation menu, and choose **Offload Media Lite**\.

   Your WordPress website is now configured to use the Media Lite Plugin\. The next time you upload a media file through WordPress, that file is automatically uploaded to your Lightsail bucket, and is served by the bucket\. To test the configuration, continue to the next section of this tutorial\.

## Step 4: Test the connection between your WordPress website and your Lightsail bucket<a name="connecting-buckets-to-wordpress-test-connection"></a>

Complete the following procedure to upload a media file to your WordPress instance and confirm that it is uploaded to, and is served from your Lightsail bucket\.

1. Pause on **Media** in the left navigation menu of the WordPress dashboard, and choose **Add New**\.  
![\[\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/2c7274df55d082980824e6f5d4268a07/images/amazon-lightsail-wordpress-dashboard-new-media.png)

1. In the details panel of the file, you should see the name of your bucket in the **Bucket** and **File URL** fields\.  
![\[\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/2c7274df55d082980824e6f5d4268a07/images/amazon-lightsail-wordpress-dashboard-new-media-details.png)
