# Viewing objects in a bucket in Amazon Lightsail<a name="amazon-lightsail-viewing-objects-in-a-bucket"></a>

 *Last updated: July 14, 2021* 

You can view all objects stored in your bucket in the Amazon Lightsail object storage service by using the Lightsail console\. You can also use the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) and AWS SDKs to list object keys in your bucket\. For more information about buckets, see [Object storage in Amazon Lightsail](buckets-in-amazon-lightsail.md)\.

## Filter objects using the Lightsail console<a name="view-objects-lightsail-console"></a>

Complete the following procedure to view objects stored in a bucket using the Lightsail console\.

1. Sign in to the [Lightsail console](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/)\.

1. On the Lightsail home page, choose the **Storage** tab\.

1. Choose the name of the bucket for which you want to view objects\.

1. The **Objects browser** pane in the **Objects tab** displays the objects and folders that are stored in your bucket\.  
![\[The object browser pane in the Lightsail console\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/f1c62fa5316bf1df017e7afb5a0e0a21/images/amazon-lightsail-bucket-object-browser-pane.png)

1. Browse to the location of the object for which you want to view properties\.

1. Add a checkmark next to the object for which you want to view properties\.

1. The **Object properties** pane on the right side of the page displays information about the object\.  
![\[The object properties pane in the Lightsail console\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/f1c62fa5316bf1df017e7afb5a0e0a21/images/amazon-lightsail-bucket-object-properties-pane.png)

   The information displayed includes:

   1. Links to view and download the object\.

   1. Actions menu \(â‹®\) to copy or delete the object\. For more information about copying and deleting objects, see [Copying or moving objects in a bucket in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-copying-moving-bucket-objects.md) and [Deleting objects in a bucket in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-deleting-bucket-objects.md)\.

   1. Object size, and last modified timestamp\.

   1. The access permission of the individual object, which could be private or public \(read\-only\)\. For more information about object permissions, see [Understanding bucket permissions in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-understanding-bucket-permissions.md)\.

   1. The metadata of the object\. The content type \(`ContentType`\) key is the only metadata supported by the Lightsail object storage service at this time\.

   1. The object key value tags\. For more information, see [Tagging objects in a bucket in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-tagging-bucket-objects.md)\.

   1. The option to manage stored versions of the object\. For more information, see [Enabling and suspending object versioning in a bucket in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-managing-bucket-object-versioning.md)\.
**Note**  
When you select multiple objects, the **Object properties** pane displays only the total size of the selected objects\.

## View objects using the AWS CLI<a name="view-objects-aws-cli"></a>

Complete the following procedure to list object keys in a bucket using the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)\. You do this by using the `list-objects-v2` command\. For more information, see [list\-objects\-v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/list-objects-v2.html) in the *AWS CLI Command Reference*\.

**Note**  
You must install the AWS CLI and configure it for Lightsail and Amazon S3 before continuing with this procedure\. For more information, see [Configuring the AWS Command Line Interface to work with Amazon Lightsail](lightsail-how-to-set-up-and-configure-aws-cli.md)\.

1. Open a Command Prompt or Terminal window\.

1. Enter one of the following commands\.
   + Enter the following command to list all object keys in your bucket\.

     ```
     aws s3api list-objects-v2 --bucket BucketName --query "Contents[].{Key: Key, Size: Size}"
     ```

     In the command, replace *BucketName* with the name of the bucket for which you want to list all objects\.
   + Enter the following command to list objects that start with a specific object key name prefix\.

     ```
     aws s3api list-objects-v2 --bucket BucketName --prefix ObjectKeyNamePrefix --query "Contents[].{Key: Key, Size: Size}"
     ```

     In the command, replace the following example text with your own:
     + *BucketName* \- The name of the bucket for which you want to list all objects\.
     + *ObjectKeyNamePrefix* \- An object key name prefix to limit the response to keys that begin with the specified prefix\.
**Note**  
These commands use the `--query` parameter to filter the response of the `list-objects-v2` request to the key value and size of each object\.

   Examples:

   Listing all object keys in a bucket:

   ```
   aws s3api list-objects-v2 --bucket DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET --query "Contents[].{Key: Key, Size: Size}"
   ```

   For the preceding command, you should see a result similar to the following example\.  
![\[Result of the AWS CLI list-objects-v2 command\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/f1c62fa5316bf1df017e7afb5a0e0a21/images/amazon-lightsail-s3api-list-objects-v2-result.png)

   Listing object keys that start with the `archived/` object key name prefix:

   ```
   aws s3api list-objects-v2 --bucket DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET --prefix archived/ --query "Contents[].{Key: Key, Size: Size}"
   ```

   For the preceding command, you should see a result similar to the following example\.  
![\[Result of the AWS CLI list-objects-v2 command\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/f1c62fa5316bf1df017e7afb5a0e0a21/images/amazon-lightsail-s3api-list-objects-v2-prefix-result.png)

## Managing buckets and objects in Lightsail<a name="viewing-objects-managing-buckets-and-objects"></a>

These are the general steps to manage your Lightsail object storage bucket:

1. Learn about objects and buckets in the Amazon Lightsail object storage service\. For more information, see [Object storage in Amazon Lightsail](buckets-in-amazon-lightsail.md)\.

1. Learn about the names that you can give your buckets in Amazon Lightsail\. For more information, see [Bucket naming rules in Amazon Lightsail](bucket-naming-rules-in-amazon-lightsail.md)\.

1. Get started with the Lightsail object storage service by creating a bucket\. For more information, see [Creating buckets in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-creating-buckets.md)\.

1. Learn about security best practices for buckets and the access permissions that you can configure for your bucket\. You can make all objects in your bucket public or private, or you can choose to make individual objects public\. You can also grant access to your bucket by creating access keys, attaching instances to your bucket, and granting access to other AWS accounts\. For more information, see [Security Best Practices for Amazon Lightsail object storage](amazon-lightsail-bucket-security-best-practices.md) and [Understanding bucket permissions in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-understanding-bucket-permissions.md)\.
