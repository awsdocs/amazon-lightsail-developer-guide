# Deleting an Amazon Lightsail instance<a name="delete-an-amazon-lightsail-instance"></a>

*Last updated: May 31, 2018*

If you no longer need an instance, you can delete it using the Amazon Lightsail console or the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)\. You stop incurring charges for the instance as soon as it’s deleted\. However, resources attached to the deleted instance, such as static IPs and snapshots, continue to incur charges until you delete them\.

**Note**  
Deleted instances cannot be recovered\. Create a snapshot of an instance before deleting if you might need the data in the instance at a later time\. For more information, see [Creating a snapshot of your Linux or Unix instance in Amazon Lightsail](lightsail-how-to-create-a-snapshot-of-your-instance.md) or [Creating a snapshot of your Windows Server instance in Amazon Lightsail](prepare-windows-based-instance-and-create-snapshot.md)\.

   1. Install the AWS CLI\. For more information, see [Installing the AWS CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) \.

   1. Configure the AWS CLI\. For more information, see [Configuring the AWS CLI](lightsail-how-to-set-up-access-keys-to-use-sdk-api-cli.md)\.

1. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt window, then type the following command to get the name of the instance you want to delete:

   ```
   aws lightsail get-instances
   ```

   You should see results similar to the following:

1. Select and copy the name of the instance you want to delete so you can use it in the next step\.
**Note**  
If the instance you want to delete does not appear, confirm that your AWS CLI is configured for the AWS Region where the instance is located\. For more information, see [Configuring the AWS CLI](lightsail-how-to-set-up-access-keys-to-use-sdk-api-cli.md)\.

1. Type the following command to delete the instance\.

   ```
   aws lightsail delete-instance --instance-name InstanceName
   ```

   In the command, replace *InstanceName* with the name of the instance\.

   If the deletion is successful, you should see a confirmation similar to the following:

**Note**  
If the deletion isn’t successful, you should see an error message\. Confirm that you copied and pasted the exact name of the instance and try again\.
