# Creating a database from a point\-in\-time backup in Amazon Lightsail<a name="amazon-lightsail-creating-a-database-from-point-in-time-backup"></a>

 *Last updated: March 15, 2019* 

You can create a new managed database by using a point\-in\-time backup in Amazon Lightsail\. Point\-in\-time backups of your database are available in 5\-minute increments, and for the previous seven days\. This gives you the ability to restore a failed database to a specific date and time in the last week\.

You can also create a new database from a snapshot\. For more information, see [Creating a database from a snapshot in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-creating-a-database-from-snapshot.md)\.

**To create a database from a point\-in\-time backup**

1. Sign in to the [Lightsail console](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/)\.

1. On the Lightsail home page, choose the **Databases** tab\.

1. Choose the name of the database for which you want to change plans\.

1. Choose the **Snapshots and restore** tab\.

1. Under the **Emergency restore** section, select the date and time of the backup that you want to use for your new database\.

1. Choose **Restore to new database**\.

1. On the **Create a new database** page, choose **Change zone** to select a different Availability Zone\. Your new database is then created in the same AWS Region as the snapshot that you selected earlier\.

1. Choose your new database plan\.

   Pick a high availability or a standard database plan\. A database created with a high availability plan has a primary database and a secondary standby database in another Availability Zone for failover support\. For more information, see [High availability databases in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-high-availability-databases.md)\.
**Note**  
You cannot choose a database plan that is smaller than the plan of the original database\.

1. Enter a name for your database\.

   Resource names:
   + Must be unique within each AWS Region in your Lightsail account\.
   + Must contain 2 to 255 characters\.
   + Must start and end with an alphanumeric character or number\.
   + Can include alphanumeric characters, numbers, periods, dashes, and underscores\.

1. Choose one of the following options to add tags to your database:
   + **Add key\-only tags** or **Edit key\-only tags** \(if tags have already been added\)\. Enter your new tag into the tag key text box, and press **Enter**\. Choose **Save** when you’re done entering your tags to add them, or choose **Cancel** to not add them\.

   + **Create a key\-value tag**, then enter a key into the **Key** text box, and a value into the **Value** text box\. Choose **Save** when you’re done entering your tags, or choose **Cancel** to not add them\.

     Key\-value tags can only be added one at a time before saving\. To add more than one key\-value tag, repeat the previous steps\.

**Note**  
For more information about key\-only and key\-value tags, see [Tags in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-tags.md)\.

1. Choose **Create database**\.

   Within minutes, your new Lightsail database is ready with the new database plan or bundle\.
