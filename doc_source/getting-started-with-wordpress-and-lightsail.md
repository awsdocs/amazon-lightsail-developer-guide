 *Last updated: May 17, 2017* 

If you're reading this, it means you successfully created a Lightsail instance that's running WordPress\. Congrats\! If you still need to [create a WordPress instance](getting-started-with-amazon-lightsail.md), go ahead and do that now\. We'll wait for you\.\.\.

Now you're ready to get started with some basic administrative tasks\. First, let's log in to your WordPress Dashboard\.

## Step 1: Go to your WordPress blog and log in<a name="go-to-your-wordpress-blog"></a>

Here's how to log in to your WordPress blog\.

1. Go to the Lightsail home page and find your WordPress blog\.

1. Copy the **Public IP** address to the clipboard\. You can find this address on the Lightsail home page or on the instance details page\.

   

1. Paste the IP address into your browser\.

   You should see something like this:

1. Choose **Manage** in the lower right corner\.

1. Choose **Login** to log in to the admin console\.

1. Use the default user name \(**user**\)\.

1. To get the password, you need to connect to your instance\.

   Go back to Lightsail and choose **Connect using SSH** to connect to your WordPress instance\.

1. Type the following:

   ```
   cat bitnami_application_password
   ```
**Note**  
If you're in a directory other than the user home directory, then type `cat $HOME/bitnami_application_password`\.

   You should see something like this:

**Important**  
You should save your password somewhere at this time\. You can always change it later to something that's easier to remember\.

1. Paste your password into the WordPress login page, and then choose **Log In**\.

   If you succeed, you'll see the WordPress Dashboard\.
