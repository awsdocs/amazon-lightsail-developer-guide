# Add alternate domains and subdomains to your SSL/TLS certificate in Amazon Lightsail<a name="add-alternate-domain-names-to-tls-ssl-certificate-https"></a>

 *Last updated: November 29, 2017* 

When you create your SSL/TLS certificate for your Lightsail load balancer, you can add alternate domains and subdomains to it\. These alternate names help ensure that all traffic to your load balancer is encrypted\.

When you specify a primary domain, you can use a fully qualified domain name such as `www.example.com` or an apex domain name such as `example.com`\.

The total number of domains and subdomains must not exceed 10, so you can add up to 9 alternate domains and subdomains to your certificate\. You might want to add entries similar to the following list\.
+ example\.com
+ example\.net
+ blog\.example\.com
+ myexamples\.com
