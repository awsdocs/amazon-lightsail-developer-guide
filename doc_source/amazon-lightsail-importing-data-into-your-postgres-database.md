You can import a database backup file into your PostgreSQL managed database in Amazon Lightsail using pgAdmin\.

**Note**  
To learn how to connect pgAdmin to your database, see [Connecting to your PostgreSQL database in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-connecting-to-your-postgres-database.md)\. For more information about creating a PostgreSQL database backup that you can import to another database, see [Backup Dialog](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/dev/backup_dialog.html) in the pgAdmin documentation\.

**To import a backup file into your database**

1. Open pgAdmin\.

1. In the list of server connections, double\-click your PostgreSQL managed database in Amazon Lightsail to connect to it\.

1. Expand the **Databases** node

1. Right\-click the database in which you would like to import data from a database backup file, then choose **Restore**\.

1. In the **Restore** form, complete the following fields:
   + **Format** — Choose the format of your backup file\.
   + **Filename** — Choose the ellipsis icon, then locate and choose the database backup file on your local drive\. After the file is highlighted, choose **Select** to go back to the **Restore** prompt\.
**Note**  
Choose the **Format** drop\-down menu, and select **All files** to view all file formats on your local drive\. Your backup file might be saved as a file type that is different than what is selected by default \(sql\)\.

   + **Number of jobs** and **Role name** — Leave these fields blank\.

1. Choose **Restore** to start the import\.

   Your import may take a few minutes or more depending on the size of the database backup file\. After the import is complete, you should see a message similar to the following:
