# Configuring IPv6 on GitLab instances in Amazon Lightsail<a name="amazon-lightsail-configure-ipv6-on-gitlab"></a>

 *Last updated: January 12, 2021* 

All instances in Amazon Lightsail have a public and a private IPv4 address assigned to them by default\. You can optionally enable IPv6 for your instances to have a public IPv6 address assigned to them\. For more information, see [IP addresses in Amazon Lightsail](understanding-public-ip-and-private-ip-addresses-in-amazon-lightsail.md) and [Enabling or disabling IPv6 in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-enable-disable-ipv6.md)\.

After you enable IPv6 for an instance that uses the GitLab blueprint, you must perform an additional set of steps to make the instance aware of its IPv6 address\. In this guide, we show you the additional steps that you must perform for GitLab instances\.

## Prerequisites<a name="ipv6-gitlab-prerequisites"></a>

Complete the following prerequisites if you haven't already:
+ Create a GitLab instance in Lightsail\. For more information, see [Create an Amazon Lightsail instance](how-to-create-amazon-lightsail-instance-virtual-private-server-vps.md)\.
+ Enable IPv6 for your GitLab instance\. For more information, see [Enabling or disabling IPv6 in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-enable-disable-ipv6.md)\.
**Note**  
New GitLab instances created on or after January 12, 2021, have IPv6 enabled by default when they are created in the Lightsail console\. You must complete the following steps in this guide to configure IPv6 on your instance even if IPv6 was enabled by default when you created your instance\.

## Configure IPv6 on a GitLab instance<a name="configure-ipv6-gitlab"></a>

Complete the following procedure to configure IPv6 on a GitLab instance in Lightsail\.

1. Sign in to the [Lightsail console](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/)\.

1. In the **Instances** tab of the Lightsail home page, locate the GitLab instance that you wish to configure, and choose the browser\-based SSH client icon to connect to it using SSH\.

1. After you're connected to your instance, enter the following command to view the IP addresses configured on your instance\.

   ```
   ip addr
   ```

   You will see a response similar to one of the following examples:
   + If your instance does not recognize its IPv6 address, then you will not see it listed in the response\. You should continue to complete steps 4 through 9 of this procedure\.  
![\[IPv6 not configured on the instance.\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/1490b6b36a8ed9d4b2232825b79c8222/images/lightsail-gitlab-ssh-ip-addr-ipv6-not-configured.png)
   + If your instance does recognize its IPv6 address, then you will see it listed in the response with a `scope global` as shown in this example\. You should stop here; you do not need to complete steps 4 through 9 of this procedure because your instance is already configure to recognize its IPv6 address\.

1. Toggle back to the Lightsail console\.

1. In the **Instances** tab of the Lightsail home page, choose the actions menu \(â‹®\) for the GitLab instance, and choose **Reboot**\.  
![\[Instance reboot option on the Lightsail home page.\]](https://d9yljz1nd5001.cloudfront.net/en_us/1490b6b36a8ed9d4b2232825b79c8222/images/lightsail-gitlab-instance-reboot.png)

   Wait a few minutes for your instance to be done rebooting before continuing to the next step\.

1. Toggle back to the SSH session of your GitLab instance\.

1. Enter the following command to view the IP addresses configured on your instance, and confirm that it is now recognizing its assigned IPv6 address\.

   ```
   ip addr
   ```

   You will see a response similar to the following example\. If your instance does recognize its IPv6 address, then you will see it listed in the response with a label of `scope global` as shown in this example\.
