# Static IP addresses in Amazon Lightsail<a name="understanding-static-ip-addresses-in-amazon-lightsail"></a>

**Note**  
A static IP is a fixed, public IP address that you can assign and reassign to an instance or other resource\. If you haven't set up a static IP address, each time you stop or restart your instance, Lightsail assigns a new public IP address\.

**Important**  
If you stop or restart your instance without first creating a static IP address and attaching it to your instance, you lose your IP address when your instance restarts\. You should create a static IP address and attach it to your instance to ensure that your instance always has the same public IP address\.
