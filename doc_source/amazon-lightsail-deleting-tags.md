# Deleting tags in Amazon Lightsail<a name="amazon-lightsail-deleting-tags"></a>

 *Last updated: November 28, 2018* 

You can delete tags from an Amazon Lightsail resource\. Deleting a tag from one resource does not delete the same tag from all other resources\. To completely delete a tag from all resources, you must remove that tag from each resource\. This guide provides the steps to delete tags from a resource\.

**Note**  
For more information about tags, what resources can be tagged, and the tag restrictions, see [Tags in Amazon Lightsail](amazon-lightsail-tags.md)\.

**To delete tags from a resource**

1. Sign in to the [Lightsail console](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/)\.

1. On the Lightsail home page, choose the tab for the resource type that you want to delete tags from\. For example, to delete tags from a DNS zone, choose the **Networking** tab\. Or choose the **Instances** tab to delete tags from an instance\.
**Note**  
Instances, container services, CDN distributions, buckets, databases, disks, DNS zones, and load balancers can be tagged using the Lightsail console\. However, more Lightsail resources can be tagged using the [Lightsail API operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/2016-11-28/api-reference/Welcome.html), or the [AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lightsail/) \(AWS CLI\) or SDKs\.
